# FEN-TO-IMAGE
Small script for creating .png images of chess positions from fen notation

## Pieces and square colors
You can change the pieces style and square colors by changing files in img folder (every image has to be 100 * 100px)

## Web
web.py creates simple flask server that can store and send the images ( Ex.: host.com/fen/rnbqk2r/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/2PPP3/2N2P2/PP4PP/R1BQKBNR/0)
